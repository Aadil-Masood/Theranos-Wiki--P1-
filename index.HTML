      <h1>Theranos</h1>
      <hr>
      <p>
       
        Theranos <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:IPA/English" target="_blank">/ˈθɛrənoʊs/</a>
        was an American privately held health technology corporation.
        <sup>[2]</sup> It was initially touted as a breakthrough
        technology company, with claims of having devised blood tests that
        required only very small amounts of blood and could be performed very
        rapidly using small automated devices the company had developed. However,
        these claims were later proven to be false. <sup>[3][4][5]</sup> Founded in 2003 by
        19-year-old Elizabeth Holmes, <sup>[6]</sup> Theranos raised more than US$700 million
        from venture capitalists and private investors, <sup>[7]</sup> resulting in a $10
        billion valuation at its peak in 2013 and 2014.<sup>[8][9]</sup> </br>
      </br>
      
         A turning point came
        in 2015 when medical research professors John Ioannidis and Eleftherios
        Diamandis, along with investigative journalist John Carreyrou of The Wall
        Street Journal, questioned the validity of Theranos' technology. The
        company faced a string of legal and commercial challenges from medical
        authorities, investors, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC),
        Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS), state attorneys general,
        former business partners, patients, and others. <sup>[10]</sup> By June 2016, it was
        estimated that Holmes' personal net worth had dropped from $4.5 billion to
        virtually nothing. <sup>[11]</sup> The company was near bankruptcy until it received,
        in 2017, a $100 million loan from Fortress Investment Group secured by its
        patents. <sup>[12]</sup> </br>
      </br>
        
         In July 2016, Theranos received sanctions from the CMS,
        including the revocation of its CLIA certificate and prohibition of Holmes
        and other company officials from owning or operating a laboratory for two
        years. <sup>[13]</sup> Theranos announced it would close its laboratory operations and
        wellness centers to work on miniature medical testing machines. <sup>[14]</sup> In
        April 2017, Theranos said it had reached a settlement agreement with
        CMS. <sup>[15]</sup> Following the CMS sanctions, the Walgreens pharmacy chain
        terminated its contract with Theranos and filed a lawsuit claiming
        continuous breaches of contract. The suit was settled out of court, with
        Theranos compensating Walgreens for a much smaller amount than the claimed
        $140 million, reported at about $30 million. After efforts to find a buyer
        went nowhere, what remained of the company dissolved on September 4,
        2018. <sup>[16]</sup> </br>
      </br>
         On March 14, 2018, Theranos, Holmes, and former company
        president Ramesh "Sunny" Balwani were charged with "massive fraud" by the
        SEC. <sup>[17]</sup> One section of the complaint says Holmes falsely claimed in 2014
        that the company had annual revenues of $100 million, a thousand times
        more than the actual figure of $100,000. <sup>[18]</sup> Theranos and Holmes agreed to
        resolve the charges against them, with Holmes paying a fine of $500,000,
        returning the remaining 18.9 million shares that she held, relinquishing
        her control of the company, and being barred from being an officer or
        director of any public company for ten years. <sup>[19]</sup> According to the
        agreement, if Theranos were acquired or otherwise liquidated, Holmes would
        not profit from her ownership until more than $750 million was returned to
        investors and other preferred shareholders. Theranos and Holmes neither
        admitted nor denied the allegations in the SEC's complaint. <sup>[7]</sup> Balwani did
        not settle. <sup>[20]</sup> On June 15, 2018, the U.S. Attorney for the Northern
        District of California announced the indictment of Holmes on wire fraud
        and conspiracy charges. Balwani was also indicted on the same charges. <sup>[21]</sup>
        The trial was scheduled to commence in August 2020, <sup>[22]</sup> but it has been
        delayed due to the COVID-19 pandemic and Holmes' pregnancy. Holmes' trial
        is currently scheduled to begin on August 31, 2021 <sup>[23]</sup>, while Balwani's
        trial has been postponed until January 11, 2022. <sup>[24]</sup>
